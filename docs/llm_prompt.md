# Yape Chrome Extension Modernization Project

## Current Status Update (May 2025)

We've made significant progress on modernizing the Yape Chrome extension:

1. Restructured the codebase into modules:
   - Split the API client into modular components for better maintainability
   - Improved error handling and debugging capabilities
   - Enhanced API response parsing for different PyLoad versions

2. Fixed major issues:
   - Implemented proper download task display from PyLoad API responses
   - Added better status handling for completed downloads
   - Added "Clear Finished" functionality to remove completed downloads
   - Fixed badge notification and notification system for downloads
   - Implemented robust error handling in service worker context

3. Recent enhancements:
   - Implemented badge counter for completed downloads
   - Added Chrome notifications for download events
   - Fixed issues with right-click context menu integration
   - Added background check system for download status updates
   - Improved state persistence across browser sessions
   - Fixed TypeScript typing issues for Chrome APIs

4. Current challenges:
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across different PyLoad API versions
   - Handling edge cases in service worker lifecycle
   - Maintaining state synchronization between popup and background script

## Original Project Overview

You are helping with the modernization of Yape (Yet Another PyLoad Extension), a Chrome extension for interacting with PyLoad download managers. The project is a ground-up rebuild of the original extension, using modern web technologies and best practices.

## Project Structure

The modernized codebase is structured in the following way:

## PyLoad API

PyLoad exposes a simple HTTP API that allows interacting with download tasks. Key endpoints include:

- `statusServer` - Check server status
- `login` - Log in to PyLoad
- `statusDownloads` - Get status of all downloads
- `getQueueData` - Get queue data
- `checkURLs` - Check if URLs are valid for download
- `addPackage` - Add a package for download
- `deletePackages` - Remove a package
- `getConfigValue` - Get a configuration value
- `setConfigValue` - Set a configuration value

## Current Implementation Status

The modernization has made significant progress:

1. ✅ Core Infrastructure
   - Project scaffolding with TypeScript, React, and Webpack
   - Modern PyLoad API client with proper error handling
   - State management system with type-safe interfaces
   - Background service with context menu integration

2. ✅ User Interface
   - Component-based UI for popup and settings pages
   - Modern UI design based on NAS Download Manager style
   - Responsive design with loading placeholders
   - Status bar with connection and speed information

3. ✅ Functionality
   - Basic download management functionality
   - Fixed download display issues across PyLoad versions
   - Added right-click download functionality
   - Connection testing and configuration
   - Toast notifications for download actions

4. ✅ Code Quality
   - Code organization with React hooks and custom components
   - Performance optimizations like debounced API calls
   - Proper error handling throughout the application
   - Type-safe interfaces for all data structures

   - Improved error handling and debug logging
   - Fixed ID handling and type conversion issues

2. **Fixed UI Issues**:

   - Added loading placeholders for smoother UX
   - Added proper download status display

3. **Fixed Download Functionality**:

   - Added TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase

## Technical Preferences

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Keep files focused and under 300 lines of code
- Follow React best practices and hooks
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use proper error handling with try/catch
- Comment complex logic and public API functions
- Prefer functional components over class components in React
- Use SCSS for styling with BEM methodology where appropriate
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

## Current Status and Challenges

The extension is now functional with many key features working well:

1. ✅ Users can add downloads via the popup UI or right-click context menu
2. ✅ Badge notifications show the number of completed downloads
3. ✅ Notifications appear when downloads are added or completed
4. ✅ "Clear Finished" functionality works properly
5. ✅ The extension maintains state across browser sessions

However, we're still experiencing some issues with the display of active and completed downloads in the UI. The downloads get added and completed correctly, but they may not always appear in the download list.


## Communication Guidelines

When making changes or suggesting improvements:
- Explain your reasoning for significant changes
- Note any potential issues or edge cases
- Ask for clarification when the requirements are unclear
- Provide code snippets for implementation suggestions
- If replacing existing functionality, explain how the new approach is better

## Next steps 
Review the app with `read_multiple_files` I am having bugs viewing current and finished downloads. The downloads get added and completed just fine however the download tray area always shows "No download tasks." instead of what is currently being downloaded or what has finished downloading. See how the NAS download manager shows current and completed tasks?
These are the console logs when I add a download
```

```

Please help maintain the high quality of this codebase by focusing on simplicity, maintainability, and robustness. The key goal is to create a modern, reliable Chrome extension that provides a better user experience than the original while maintaining all functionality.
