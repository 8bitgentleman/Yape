# Yape Chrome Extension Modernization Project

## Current Status Update (May 2025)

We've made significant progress on modernizing the Yape Chrome extension:

1. Restructured the codebase into modules:
   - Split the API client into modular components for better maintainability
   - Improved error handling and debugging capabilities
   - Enhanced API response parsing for different PyLoad versions

2. Fixed major issues:
   - Implemented proper download task display from PyLoad API responses
   - Added better status handling for completed downloads
   - Added "Clear Finished" functionality to remove completed downloads
   - Fixed badge notification and notification system for downloads
   - Implemented robust error handling in service worker context

3. Recent enhancements:
   - Implemented badge counter for completed downloads
   - Added Chrome notifications for download events
   - Fixed issues with right-click context menu integration
   - Added background check system for download status updates
   - Improved state persistence across browser sessions
   - Fixed TypeScript typing issues for Chrome APIs

4. Current challenges:
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across different PyLoad API versions
   - Handling edge cases in service worker lifecycle
   - Maintaining state synchronization between popup and background script

## Original Project Overview

You are helping with the modernization of Yape (Yet Another PyLoad Extension), a Chrome extension for interacting with PyLoad download managers. The project is a ground-up rebuild of the original extension, using modern web technologies and best practices.

## Project Structure

The modernized codebase is structured in the following way:

## PyLoad API

PyLoad exposes a simple HTTP API that allows interacting with download tasks. Key endpoints include:

- `statusServer` - Check server status
- `login` - Log in to PyLoad
- `statusDownloads` - Get status of all downloads
- `getQueueData` - Get queue data
- `checkURLs` - Check if URLs are valid for download
- `addPackage` - Add a package for download
- `deletePackages` - Remove a package
- `getConfigValue` - Get a configuration value
- `setConfigValue` - Set a configuration value

## Current Implementation Status

The modernization has made significant progress:

1. ✅ Core Infrastructure
   - Project scaffolding with TypeScript, React, and Webpack
   - Modern PyLoad API client with proper error handling
   - State management system with type-safe interfaces
   - Background service with context menu integration

2. ✅ User Interface
   - Component-based UI for popup and settings pages
   - Modern UI design based on NAS Download Manager style
   - Responsive design with loading placeholders
   - Status bar with connection and speed information

3. ✅ Functionality
   - Basic download management functionality
   - Fixed download display issues across PyLoad versions
   - Added right-click download functionality
   - Connection testing and configuration
   - Toast notifications for download actions

4. ✅ Code Quality
   - Code organization with React hooks and custom components
   - Performance optimizations like debounced API calls
   - Proper error handling throughout the application
   - Type-safe interfaces for all data structures

## Technical Preferences

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Keep files focused and under 300 lines of code
- Follow React best practices and hooks
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use proper error handling with try/catch
- Comment complex logic and public API functions
- Prefer functional components over class components in React
- Use SCSS for styling with BEM methodology where appropriate
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

## Current Status and Challenges

The extension is now functional with many key features working well:

1. ✅ Users can add downloads via the popup UI or right-click context menu
2. ✅ Badge notifications show the number of completed downloads
3. ✅ Notifications appear when downloads are added or completed
4. ✅ "Clear Finished" functionality works properly
5. ✅ The extension maintains state across browser sessions

However, we're still experiencing some issues with the display of active download bars in the UI. As well as notificaitons


## Communication Guidelines

When making changes or suggesting improvements:
- Explain your reasoning for significant changes
- Note any potential issues or edge cases
- Ask for clarification when the requirements are unclear
- Provide code snippets for implementation suggestions
- If replacing existing functionality, explain how the new approach is better

## Next steps 
Review the app with `read_multiple_files` 

Please help maintain the high quality of this codebase by focusing on simplicity, maintainability, and robustness. The key goal is to create a modern, reliable Chrome extension that provides a better user experience than the original while maintaining all functionality.
